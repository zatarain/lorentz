This repository defines the `ether`-structure (infrastructure as code) for my personal projects. Its name comes after [Hendrik Lorentz][hendrik-lorentz] who was a Dutch physics and his Ether Theory, which also gives the name to the Ethernet standard for Networks (yes, this is yet another nerdy reference from me).

## üî≠ Overview

The infrastructure is defined using [Hashicorp Configuration Language][hcl-docs] and can be provisioned to [Amazon Web Services][aws-docs] using [Terraform][terraform]. The repository is designed to use multiple AWS accounts, such as development and production accounts.

### üß© Structure

The code in the repository is designed to have at least two Terraform workspaces. In particular I am using four workspaces each of them linked to my AWS accounts and three of them linked to GitHub environments (sharing the same name):

* **Default**. It holds resources that cannot be replicated or must be shared between the other accounts (e. g. registered domain name, the Terraform State, etc).
* **Development**. It holds the resources for development and the ones I use from my local machine, so its quite unstable.
* **Staging**. This workspace is more stable than development and it's used to test with similar data as production.
* **Production**. It holds the live resources and data for my personal projects.
